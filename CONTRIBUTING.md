# Contributing

We <3 pull requests and [issues]. Feel free to open one to share something with
us.

Use `deno lint`, `deno fmt` and `deno test` before any commit, and fix any
errors. Try to build the application (`make crots`).

Then follow the commit convention (prefix each commit with a tag, such as
[chore], [doc], [feature], [fix], [release]).

[issues]: https://github.com/ponsfrilus/crots-timesheet/issues
